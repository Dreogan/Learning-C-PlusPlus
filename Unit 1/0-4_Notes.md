# 0.4 Introduction to C++ Development - NOTES

### A simplistric approach to developing C++ programs:

1. Figure out what problem you want to solve. The idea should be capable of being explained clearly.
    - Exmaple: "I want to write a program that allows me to input text, save the text, and read the text."
2. Determine _how_ you are going to implement a **good** solution. Solutions should have the following attributes:
    - They are not unnecessarily complicated or hard to understand.
    - They are well documented.
    - They are built with modularity in mind.
    - They are stable, and built so they can provide useful errors when something unintended happens
Take care in creating your solution to save time and to create a more stable program.
3. Write the program. Programs need to have "source code", also referred to as just "code".
4. Compile the program
5. Link object files
6. Test Program
7. Debug program and repeat from 4 until program has achieved stability.

### Best practices:

The primary source code file should be named ==main.cpp== to indicate it is the main file in the source code.
